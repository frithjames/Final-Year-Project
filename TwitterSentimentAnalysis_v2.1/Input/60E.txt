n | *someone expresses opinion**internet, in furious, cracking voice, spit firing from mouth*"BUT WHAT ABOUT *MY* OPINION?"
n | I've never said anyone was an idiot for enjoying any movie. Except National Security.  If you like National Security, you're an idiot.
n | It's a case study in preemptive opinion bullying.  I'm shocked at how vicious people I respect are being. https://t.co/9hIUVNnlUt
n | The internet is a safehaven for bullies of all kinds.  Seeing them crash into each other is, for me, the scariest part.
n | What's crazy is how ugly the reaction to Ghostbusters has actually been.  What's crazy is how blurry the lines have actually gotten.
n | His public punishment and ridicule is fascinating and familiar to me.  It's always incredible to see a guy lynched for his opinions.
n | Nah.  That trailer is rough.  The movie might be better, but that trailer: fucking yikes. https://t.co/PRMLPtsfo6
