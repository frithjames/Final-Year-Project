n | Okay, I'm being told that I probably won't get my channel deleted. Still, this sucks. Might be Vimeo ahoy for me
n | So I couldn't skip songs and ended up listening to ambient noise for 30 minutes. Not so fun.
n | RT @ChezneyforNow: Don't let social media fool you , people are going through serious issues and nobody is there for them
